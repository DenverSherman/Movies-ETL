# Movies-ETL
movies on Wikipedia from 1990 to 2018, JSON

## Background
A practical application of the ETL data pipeline. Here, I extract data from the wikipedia site and Kaggle datasets. This is transformed, merged, then  loaded into Github for later use.

In the Resources folder, please find screenshots detailing length of each created database, both movies and ratings.
